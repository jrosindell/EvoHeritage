# EvoHeritage
A set of software tools for EvoHeritage calculations in R

# EvoHeritage tools
The root directory contains a set of functions for calculating EvoHeritage that can be sourced and then used in analyses
The root directory also contains a test file that can be sourced to confirm these functions are working correctly
The working directory for running the unit tests should be the root

# Example applications
Sub directories contain individual example applications of the main functions
Each example application has a directory called Data which is excluded (gitignored) from the GitHub repository
The working directory for running any of the example applications should be the directory of that application
