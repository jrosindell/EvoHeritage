# filename guide

The filenames are the scenario variables in the original code.
Their meaning in terms of variables for the default run is given below

* "CretaceousAll2" was for rho = 10^-2 using EvoHeritage from Cretaceous and before* "JurassicAll2" was for rho = 10^-2 using EvoHeritage from Jurassic and before

* "JurassicAll3" was for rho = 10^-3 using EvoHeritage from Jurassic and before

* "CretaceousAll3" was for rho = 10^-3 using EvoHeritage from Cretaceous and before

* "ED" was for classic ED
* "EDcomp" was for rho = 0 using EvoHeritage from Quaternary and before (this is mathematically identical to ED but included as a demonstration of this fact)

* "EDcomprho" was for rho = 10^-2 using EvoHeritage from Quaternary and before (this is all EvoHeritage as Quaternary stretches to present day)

* "CretaceousAllED" was for rho = 0 using EvoHeritage from Cretaceous and before (this is an augmented verison of ED)
* "JurassicAllED" was for rho = 0 using EvoHeritage from Jurassic and before (this is an augmented verison of ED)
